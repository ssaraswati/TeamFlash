## Code

â€¦is moderately average. We know. We hacked it together on a client site eons ago, then published it when we wanted to re-use it elsewhere. Don't hate us: send a pull request instead.

We also know that there are other projects that do the same thing, like [SouthsideSoftware/BuildLight](https://github.com/SouthsideSoftware/BuildLight). We wrote this a while ago, and wanted to publish it anyway.
